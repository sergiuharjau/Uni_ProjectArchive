The Chatbot is fully working. Obviously, since it's only my work, it doesn't talk back, 
but the account management works great, and so does InfoHub.

Start serverChatBot.py first, and then continue with clientChatBot.py

The database is wiped at the moment, feel free to change that by creating accounts!
