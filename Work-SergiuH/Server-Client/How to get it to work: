In this folder there are two files, the server, and the client. 
In order to get it to work you obviously need python, either clone it into codio, or download it to your pc.

If you are on windows, the notepad file will be very hard to read, it's just the way linux does it, sorry.
Codio is by far the best way to do this.

Once you have python, run the server file first, followed by the client one.
Inputing "end" on the client bash will stop the connection.
Thanks! 

#note: You will need two terminals in codio in order to get this to work.
