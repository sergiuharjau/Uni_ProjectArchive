I have pretty much commented every line, so everyone can understand what's going on.

In short: It asks a user if they have an account, if yes, the user tries to login, if not, the user gets to create an account.

The function accountMain returns True when the user has successfully logged in, and false when he hasn't. 

It's fully working at the moment.
