I guess I'm just going by my own experience, I have an entire group of friends that only all know each other because we smoked at school, I'm pretty much the only one left now that still does, but they've all quit for literally all of the reasons you listed in your above comment.

I think it's rare for people to actually have a "straw that breaks the camel's back" moment, you just finally reach the point where you actually want to quit, instead of just knowing that you should.

Which I suppose is why you got the responses you did, we all know we shouldn't smoke, we all know it's expensive, all our doctors tell us to quit literally every time we see them, we all have family and friends that don't like it, but none of those usually actually force to quit, if you don't really want to it just won't work.
